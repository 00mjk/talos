        title = "Kexec and capabilities"
        description = """\
When kexec support is disabled Talos no longer drops Linux capabilities (`CAP_SYS_BOOT` and `CAP_SYS_MODULES`) for child processes.
That is helpful for advanced use-cases like Docker-in-Docker.

If you want to permanently disable kexec and capabilities dropping, pass `kexec_load_disabled=1` argument to the kernel.
For example:

```yaml
install:
  extraKernelArgs:
    - kexec_load_disabled=1
```

Please note that capabilities are dropped before machine configuration is loaded,
so disabling kexec via `machine.sysctls` (like in the section `Reboots via kexec`) will not be enough.
